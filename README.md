🚀 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
🔍 Project Overview:
I recently worked on a Customer Churn Prediction Model to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using machine learning algorithms. This project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and churn prediction modeling.

📌 Key Tasks Completed:
✅ Data Preparation: Cleaned, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and split data into training & testing sets.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized churn trends, contract types, payment methods, and customer demographics.
✅ Customer Segmentation: Clustered customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type using K-Means clustering to identify at-risk customers.
✅ Churn Prediction Model: Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to predict churn, evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
✅ Feature Importance Analysis: Identified key factors influencing churn, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

📊 Tech Stack Used:
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
🔹 Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Means Clustering)
🔹 Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)

🎯 Key Insights:

Customers with month-to-month contracts and higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.
Long-tenure customers have lower churn rates, making customer retention strategies crucial.
Random Forest performed best in predicting churn with high accuracy.
🔗 Next Steps:

Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
Deploying the model using Flask for real-time predictions
Exploring Deep Learning techniques for advanced churn prediction
💡 Excited to keep learning and applying Data Science & Machine Learning to solve real-world problems!
